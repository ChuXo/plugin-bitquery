1. Filter out token that seems to have random names like shonc2m103r19jcnc2
2. Very less volume (like below 1000$ or 0$) or very less swaps (like below 10 or 0) are an indicator of scams, especially when they have huge price gains, filter them out
3. Ignore stable coins (like USDC, USDT, BUSD, DAI, etc.) or native coins (like WETH, ETH, ARB, BNB, etc.)
4. Focus on most recent created pairs, because for investors, being early is the key, so provide enoughalpha of promising looking tokens.
